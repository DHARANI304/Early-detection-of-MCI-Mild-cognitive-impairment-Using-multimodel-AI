# 🧠 Alzheimer’s Multi-Modal Early Detection System

A machine learning prototype designed to assist in the early detection of **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)** and early-stage Alzheimer’s Disease using a multi-modal AI approach.

This system integrates clinical test data, speech biomarkers, structural MRI scans, and facial behavioral markers into a unified predictive framework.

---

## 📌 Project Motivation

Early detection significantly improves patient outcomes in Alzheimer’s care. Traditional diagnosis methods can be expensive, time-consuming, and inaccessible in early stages.

This project demonstrates a scalable, low-cost AI-powered screening prototype combining four independent modalities to evaluate cognitive health risk.
